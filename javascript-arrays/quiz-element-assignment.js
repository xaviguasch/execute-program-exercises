// Write a function that puts a 0 in element 1 of an array. Remember that arrays are zero-indexed.

// Make sure that the function returns undefined. Returning undefined indicates that the function modifies some data: either its arguments or global variables.

// (If a function returns nothing, but also modifies nothing, then it does nothing at all! It must return something, modify something, or both. By returning undefined, we tell callers of our function that it modifies something.)

function setSecondElementToZero(nums) {}

const array = [0, 0, 0]

console.log(setSecondElementToZero(array))
